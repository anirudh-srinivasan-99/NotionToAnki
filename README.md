# NotionToAnki
This project transforms study preparation by automating the creation of flashcards directly from Notion notes. Using Notion as the note repository, Geminiâ€™s NLP capabilities generate structured flashcard questions, which are then seamlessly uploaded to Anki for spaced repetition learning.
